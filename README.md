# coderbus-mc

Minecraft version 1.7.10

Forge version 10.13.4.1614

Minecraft pack based on reika's mods for the coderbus group. For easy setup it's recommended you make your minecraft installation a repository and pull from this repository to update. Forge is not included and you'll need to install it yourself.

You're a coder, you should know how to do that.
